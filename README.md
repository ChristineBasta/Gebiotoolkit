# GebioToolkit

We present the GebioToolkit for extracting multilingual parallel corpora at sentence level, with document and gender information from Wikipedia biographies. Despite the gender inequalities present in Wikipedia, the toolkit has been designed to extract corpus balanced in gender. 
While our toolkit is able to customize the languages for which we are extracting the multilingual corpus, in this work, we extracted a corpus of 2000 sentences in English, Spanish and Catalan, which has been post-edited by native speakers to be valid as test dataset for machine translation.
